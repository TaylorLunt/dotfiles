### A collection of my dotfiles

I'm currently running Debian on my desktop with i3 and emacs.

# main dotfiles
| File         | Description                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| .Xkeymap     | Defines a few custom changes to the X keymap. Mostly make F15 a modifier key so I can use it as Hyper_R (I have it bound on my Ergodox EZ keyboard). |
| .bashrc      | Simple bash config which mostly just sets up a few aliases and adds a few things to the path.                                                        |
| .profile     | Calls .bashrc.                                                                                                                                       |
| configure.sh | A work-in-progress, but eventually I want this script to completely and idempotently configure a fresh Debian install for me.                        |
| make.sh      | Makes symlinks to all of the dotfiles in this repo.                                                                                                  |
