## main dotfiles
| File         | Description                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| .Xkeymap     | Defines a few custom changes to the X keymap. Mostly make F15 a modifier key so I can use it as Hyper_R (I have it bound on my Ergodox EZ keyboard). |
| .bashrc      | Simple bash config which mostly just sets up a few aliases and adds a few things to the path.                                                        |
| .profile     | Calls .bashrc.                                                                                                                                       |
| configure.sh | A work-in-progress, but eventually I want this script to completely and idempotently configure a fresh Debian install for me.                        |
| make.sh      | Makes symlinks to all of the dotfiles in this repo.                                                                                                  |

## doom emacs stuff

|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| init.el     | The default doom packages I have enabled. Some stuff I have enabled, but don't use yet, like the RSS stuff.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| packages.el | Packages which don't come with Doom. They include [emojify](https://github.com/iqbalansari/emacs-emojify) to add emoji support ðŸ˜‚, and [evil-colemak-basics](https://github.com/wbolster/evil-colemak-basics) to provide basic colemak keybindings (though many are missing). |
| config.el            | My personal emacs config. It includes a lot of remapping to colemak keybindings, as well as [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Emacs-instructions).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## i3 stuff
In i3 I use i3bar with i3blocks. Blocks come from various repositories, and there are some custom blocks as well.
